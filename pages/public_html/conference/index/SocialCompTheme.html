<h2>SocialComp 2012 Conference Theme</h2>

<p>
  Social computing is an area of computer science that is concerned with the 
  intersection of social behavior and computational systems. Social computing 
  can have a tremendous impact in the business world and can significantly affect 
  society, and outline possible changes in organized human action that could be 
  brought about. Social computing can also have negative effects associated with 
  it, including security issues. Social computing should be a priority for 
  researchers and business leaders and illustrate the fundamental shifts in 
  communication, computing, collaboration, and commerce brought about by this trend.

  Social computing is the collaborative and interactive aspect of online behavior. 
  The term can be understood in contrast to personal computing, which describes the 
  behavior of isolated users.

<p>
  Blogs, wikis, Twitter, RSS, instant messaging, multiplayer gaming and open source 
  development, as well as social networking and social bookmarking sites are some 
  elements of social computing. Social computing is closely related to the concept of 
  Web&nbsp;2.0, which can be thought of as the framework of applications supporting 
  the processes of social computing.

<p>
  The Annual International Conference on Social Computing and Behavioral 
  Modeling&nbsp;(SocialComp) aims at providing opportunities for academics, 
  researchers, experienced professionals and business people to share their 
  research in the area of Social Computing with the world.
