    <h1>Restoring a backup of the workspace</h1>

    <p>
      Entity Binz are saved in the workspace directory when the server stops. 
      EntityBinz are  also backuped at regular interval in the backup directory
      because an unexpected  power shutdown may always occur.
      The time interval between two backup is defined in millis by the constant 
      <code>BACKUP_INTERVAL</code> of the class 
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/Parameters.html' target='_blank'>Parameters</a>. 
      By default, it is set to 2 hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Backup process.</b>
      To build a backup, SAW just saves all Entity Binz in the <code>workspace</code> directory 
      and make a copy of this copy this directory as <code>backup/N.workspace</code> 
      where <code>N</code> is the current time in millis as provided by Java. 
      Thus, the more recent backup is the one with the higher <code>N</code>. 
      SAW keeps at most 1024 backups but not consecutive backups. When the number of backups 
      exceeds 1024, some randomly chosen backups are deleted. This allows to keep the last 
      128 backups and a mix of older backups.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Listing backups.</b>
      The utility ListBackups produces a list of the backups with readable dates. To execute it,
      go to <code>SAW-SDK</code> directory and execute the following Maven command:
    </p>

<pre>
mvn exec:java -Plistbackups
</pre>

    <p>
      <b>Restoring a backup.</b>
      One may want to restore a backup of the Entity Binz. 
      The first main reason for doing that may be a bad crash or a bug of the server leaving 
      the current workspace in a corrupted state. Another possible can be to restore the state 
      of the server as it was in the past.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>N.B.</b>
      Before restoring a backup, save the current <code>workspace</code> directory as <code>workspace.save</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then replace the <code>workspace</code> directory with the <code>backup/N.workspace</code> you have chosen.
      Restart the server and check if it works.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Partial restoration. </b>
      If you think that only a few Entuty Binz are corrupted, you may also choose to restore only a 
      few Entity Binz in the current workspace by replacing their data files in the subdirectories 
      of workspace with the data files from the chosen backup. For instance, the 
      data file of Entity Binz <code>org.site.entities.MyEntity</code> is:
      </p>

<pre>
workspace/org/site/entities/MyEntity/binz
</pre>

    <p>
      You may take this file from a backup and copy it in the workspace. Take care, 
      depending on your application, the different Entity Binz may be related one to another. 
      This, if you do a partial recovery, be sure to use a coherent set of Entity Binz to
      restore.
