    <h1>SAW SDK Setup</h1>

    <p>
      This section explains how to setup SAW SDK on your computer.
    </p>

    <h2>Operating system</h2>

    <p>
      SAW-SDK has been developped under UNIX systems. 
      It has been tested under Linux, SunOS, Solaris, FreeBSD and MacOSX. 
      It seems to work under Windows systems.
      The development of a Web application can be done on any today reasonnable 
      computer running one of these OS. 
      The resulting Web application can be run on the same kind of computer. 
    </p>

    <h2>Java</h2>

    <p>
      SAW-SDK assumes Java 1.6. 
    </p>

    <h2>Maven</h2>

    <p>
      SAW-SDK requires the installation of Maven, currently&nbsp;v2 and available at
      <a href='http://maven.apache.org' target='_blank'>http://maven.apache.org</a>.
      Please, do follow the installation instruction of the Apache Maven project.
      The SAW developper does not need to understand Maven but it must be able to
      execute Maven compilation commands given in this document.
    </p>

    <h2>The source code</h2>

    <p>
      SAW SDK source code is avalaible as a ZIP or a tar.gz at
      <a href='http://github.com/bellot/SAW-SDK' target='_blank'>http://github.com/bellot/SAW-SDK</a>.
      Please, do expand the archive anywhere on your disk. You will get
      a <code>SAW-SDK</code> directory.
    </p>






    <h2>Compile and test</h2>

    <p>
      Go to the <code>SAW-SDK</code> directory and run the Maven commands:
    </p>

<pre>
mvn clean
mvn install
mvn javadoc:javadoc
</pre>

    <p>
      Then go to the <code>SAW-SDK/pages</code> directory and run the Maven command:
    </p>

<pre>
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass='org.saw.server.Main'
</pre>


    <p>
      Please, note that the first run of this command will download a lot
      of Maven tools in your local Maven repository and it will donwload
      all Java libraries required by SAW SDK. 
      This may take several minutes&nbsp;!
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, open your favorite browser with the page determined by your settings, probably:
    </p>

<pre>
http://127.0.0.1:8080
</pre>

    <h2>Configuring your server</h2>

    <p>
      The main configuration file is the file:
    </p>

<pre>
saw/src/main/java/org/saw/Parameters.java
</pre>

    <p>
      The following static attributes of the class
      <code>Parameters</code> must be set in order 
      to setup the network parameters:
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>String WEB_SITE</code> must contain the IP of the sever. 
	  It can be the IP of the computer where the SAW application is runned. 
	  If the SAW application is proxied by an Apache server, it is the IP of the Apache server.
	</p>
      </lI>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>String SITE_PREFIX</code> must contain <code>""</code> 
	  unless the SAW application is reverse proxied by an Apache server. 
	  In this case, there is a prefix that redirects to the SAW application.
	</p>
      </lI>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>String BIND_INTERFACE</code> must contain the IP of the computer 
	  interface where the Web application will listen to. 
	  It can be <code>"127.0.0.1"</code> for local testing or the IP adress 
	  of the LAN card for distant testing.
	</p>
      </lI>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>int HTTP_SERVER_PORT</code> must contain the port number where the 
	  server will listen for ordinary HTTP connection. 
	  Unless you are root, choose a free port such as <code>8080</code>. If
	  <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT</code> is set to z&eacute;ro, the server will not handle
	  HTTP connexions.
	</p>
      </lI>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <code>int HTTPS_SERVER_PORT</code> must contain the port number 
	  where the server will listen for SSL connection&nbsp;(HTTPS). Unless you are root, 
	  choose a free port different from the previous such as <code>8081</code>. If
	  <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT</code> is set to z&eacute;ro, the server will not handle
	  HTTPS connexions.
	</p>
      </lI>

    </ul>

    <p>
      Several configuration cases are described below.
    </p>

    <ul>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <b>Personal usage and testing.</b>
	  The SAW application is running on a simple computer for test purposes 
	  and this computer alone will access the SAW application. Then :
	</p>

<pre>
WEB_SITE       = "127.0.0.1"
SITE_PREFIX    = ""
BIND_INTERFACE = "127.0.0.1"
</pre>

	<p>
          If you are root on this host you can choose <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT=80</code>
	  and <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT=443</code> so that the SAW application can be 
	  accessed as <code>http://127.0.0.1</code> and <code>https://127.0.0.1</code>. 
	  Otherwise, you should use free ports, for instance: <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT=8080</code>
	  and <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT=8181</code>. And the SAW application will be 
	  accessed as <code>http://127.0.0.1:8080</code> and <code>https://127.0.0.1:8181</code>.	
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <b>Direct access to the Internet.</b>
	  The SAW application is running on the host <code>rivf.enst.fr</code> and this host 
	  has access to the Internet. No proxy is needed. Then :
	</p>

<pre>
WEB_SITE       = "rivf.enst.fr"
SITE_PREFIX    = ""
BIND_INTERFACE = "rivf.enst.fr"
</pre>

	<p>
          Of course, <code>rivf.enst.fr</code> can be replaced by the numerical IP of
	  the computer.
	  If you are root on this host you can choose <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT=80</code> and 
	  <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT=443</code> so that the SAW application can be accessed 
	  as <code>http://rivf.enst.fr</code> and <code>https://rivf.enst.fr</code>. 
	  Otherwise, you should use free ports, for instance: <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT=8080</code>
	  and <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT=8181</code>. And the SAW application will be 
	  accessed as <code>http://rivf.enst.fr:8080</code> and <code>https://rivf.enst.fr:8181</code>.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <b>Reverse proxying by Apache.</b>
	  The SAW application is running on the host <code>rivf.enst.fr</code> and is proxied by 
	  the Apache server <code>www.infres.enst.fr</code> with prefix <code>/saw</code>. 
	  That means that <code>http://www.infres.enst.fr/rivf</code> refers to the SAW application. 
	  In this case:
	</p>

<pre>
WEB_SITE       = "www.infres.enst.fr"
SITE_PREFIX    = "/saw"
BIND_INTERFACE = "rivf.enst.fr"
</pre>

	<p>
          Of course, <code>rivf.enst.fr</code> can be replaced by the numerical IP of
	  the computer.
	  In this case, <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT</code> can be set to <code>0</code>
	  because HTTPS is handled by the Apache server. 
	  <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT</code> can be set to any port that will be 
	  used in the configuration of the Apache server.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
	  <b>Virtual Hosting by Apache.</b>
	  The SAW application is running on the host <code>rivf.enst.fr</code>
	  and is proxied by the Apache server <code>www.infres.enst.fr</code> with a 
	  virtual host <code>www.rivf.org</code>. That means that 
	  <code>http://www.rivf.org</code> refers to the SAW application. 
	  In this case:
	</p>

<pre>
WEB_SITE = "www.rivf.org"
SITE_PREFIX = ""
BIND_INTERFACE = "rivf.enst.fr"
</pre>

	<p>
          Of course, <code>rivf.enst.fr</code> can be replaced by the numerical IP of
	  the computer.
          In this case, <code>HTTPS_SERVER_PORT</code> can be set to <code>0</code>
	  because HTTPS is handled by the Apache server. 
	  <code>HTTP_SERVER_PORT</code> can be set to any port that will be used in 
	  the configuration of the Apache server.
	</p>
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      By default, the first <b>Personal usage and testing</b> is installed
      in the distribution.
    </p>





    <h2>Compile again</h2>

    <p>
      After configuring your server, go to the <code>SAW-SDK</code> directory and run the Maven command:
    </p>

<pre>
mvn clean
mvn install
mvn javadoc:javadoc
</pre>
