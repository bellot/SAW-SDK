    <h1>Notes on Session Binz programming</h1>

    <p>
      <b>About errors and exceptions.</b>
      If an error occurs during the execution of a Session Binz, an exception is usually raised by Java.
      This exception will be caught by the Transaction object and an <i>Internal error</i> message
      will be displayed. The error will be logged in the <code>SAW-SDK/pages/SAW.log</code> file.
      However, if the Session Binz has already began to output data, that means if it has executed
      the <code>beginOutput()</code> method, then the  <i>Internal error</i> HTTP Response wil be sent
      after the normal HTTP header. And the error will not be correcly displayed.
      That's why the output of a Session Binz must begin only when we are sure that no errors will occur.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Phases in he handle method:</b>
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  If necessary, the Session binz handle method looks at the session user, 
	  inside the Session environment object, to validate it. For instance, 
	  an already logged user may be required. Sometimes, the method may have to check 
	  its rights in the context of the Web application.
	  <i>
	    We will explain how to manage users in a later tutorial.
	  </i>
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	</p>
	Then the method looks at the Transaction variables&nbsp;(GET and POST variables) to validate them. 
	If they are not sound, the Session binz handle method can ask the Transaction object to issue a 
	bad request answer&nbsp;(suspecting a fraud tentative for instance) and then terminates. This must be
	done by throwing an ordinary exception or one of the specialized exceptions of the
	<a href='javadoc/org/saw/exceptions/package-summary.html' target='_blank'>org.saw.exception</a>
	package. The exception will be logged in <code>SAW-SDK/pages/SAW.log</code>. If something special such
	as a fraud is detected, it could be a good idea to log the event using the static functions in class
	<a href='javadoc/org/saw/util/logs/Logs.html' target='_blank'>Logs</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Now, the method does its business, preparing its response. To do that, the Session Binz
	  has access to the Web application Entity Binz that contain the Web application data. 
	  As all Session binz have a priori access to all Entity binz, some kind of synchronization 
	  must be required depending on the application. In Java, the use of a non-coherent object 
	  may raise an exception that will be caught. When the Java exception is caught, the 
	  Transaction will output an internal error response. 
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Finally, themethod produces its output. First, it asks the container Transaction object to 
	  issue the appropriate HTTP response header. Then the Session binz object writes its output 
	  using the bytes or characters write methods provided by the Transaction object. 
	  And it terminates its execution. As told above, the programmer should minimize the risk
	  of error in this step.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Of course, the four steps described above can be mixed but it is a safe programming 
      rule to program the business method as described, especially to get a coherent response 
      in case of error. For instance, if an error is detected after the output has begun, then
      the error message will be mixed with the normal output. That is why all checks have to be
      done before the output begins.
