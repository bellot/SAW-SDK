    <h1>Overview of SAW SDK</h1>
    <p>
      SAW SDK allows Java developpers to easily program very efficient Web applications. 
      A SAW Web application is entirely written in Java behaves as a Web server dedicated 
      to a single Web application. 
      To provide the best programming environment, SAW  reproduces its own version of the triplet 
      <b>Container&nbsp;- Session Beans&nbsp;- Entity Beans</b> of 
      <a href='http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gexaf.html' target='_blank'>Java&nbsp;EE&nbsp;6</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Session Beans, called <b>Session Binz</b>, are in charge of answering the 
      HTTP(S) requests. In order to operate, they rely on Container objects 
      called <b>Transaction Binz</b>. 
      When a request reaches the Web application, a Transaction Binz is in charge 
      of the request. It opens the communication channels&nbsp;(sockets), handles
      the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, decodes the HTTP header fields, extracts the 
      GET and POST variables, retrieves the client session data if any and, finally, 
      selects a Session Binz to answer the request according to the request path. 
      The client session data are named <b>Session Environment</b>. 
      When the Session Binz operates to answer the request, it has access to 
      the Transaction Binz. 
      Thus, it can access the user session data, information on the user client
      and GET and POST variables.
      The normal bevior of a Session Binz can be described as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	It checks the user rights using the data contained in the Session Environment 
	provided by the Transaction Binz.
	The Session Environment contains the client id and the client ip. 
	It also contains session variables in the sense of PHP. 
	The Session Environment is fully customizable by the programmer.
      </lI>
      <li>
	Using the Session Environment, the GET and POST variables and the Web 
	application data, the Session Binz builds a Model&nbsp;(in the sense 
	of the Model&nbsp;- View&nbsp;- Controller design pattern) of the 
	request response. 
	This is the implementation of the <b>Business Logic</b>. 
	The Web application data are provided by Entity Binz described later 
	meanwhile other data are provided by the Transaction Binz.
      </li>
      <li>
	From the Model, the Session Binz output a XHMTL view that will be sent 
	and displayed by the cleint agent, usually a Web browser. 
	The Transaction Binz provides various HTTP Response headers. 
	It also provides output functions. 
	If the client agent supports compressed answers, the Transaction Binz 
	transparently handles it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      SAW has been thought to ease the programemr's work. 
      The programmer has to focus on the Business Logic only. 
      All technical aspects are handled by the Transaction Binz. 
      In order to avoid the uncheckable litany of print function call of PHP 
      programs, SAW proposes the use of <b>XML Elements Compilation (XEC)</b>. 
      XEC allows a Session Binz to represent its output as a XML DOM-like tree 
      that can be compiled into very efficient output functions. 
      Another strenght of SAW is that almost evrything is cached in memory or in disk files. 
      Entity Binz are in memory when used. And Session Binz caches their output in memory too. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Entity Binz are global objects that contain the Web application data. 
      In Web Application Servers, Entity Beans are application data. 
      An Entity class matches a table in a relational database and each instance 
      is a row in that table. 
      The mapping of entities objects to the relational database tables is 
      done via hibernation mechanisms such as JPA (Java Persistence API) or another. 
      SAW takes advantage that it is dedicated to a single Web application and that, 
      most of the cases, data can be kept in memory. 
      Thus, Entity Beans are memory objects loaded at the start of the server and saved on disk at the shutdown of the server. 
      They can contains any type of serializable Java data.
      SAW provides generic functions to manage Entity Binz so that the programmer 
      does not have to worry about the etchnical details. 
      Of course, the programmer is allowed to use databases when facing huge amount of data.
