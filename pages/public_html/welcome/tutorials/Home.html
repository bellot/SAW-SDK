    <h1>What is SAW SDK ?</h1>

    <p>
      SAW SDK is a Software Development Kit that allows Java developpers to easily 
      build Web applications. SAW SDK is not a Content Management System&nbsp;(CMS) 
      nor a Web Applications Sever&nbsp;(WAS). 
      SAW SDK allows you to develop an entire Web application that acts as a server. 
      SAW SDK requires Java programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thanks to the functions proposed by SAW SDK, the programming effort is reduced 
      to the minimum, mainly to program the Business Logic of the application. These 
      functions propose mechanisms that makes the Web Application much more efficient 
      than equivalent applications developped in other frameworks.
