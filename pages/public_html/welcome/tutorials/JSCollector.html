    <h1>Collecting JavaScript</h1>

    <p>
      As satted in
      <a href='CSSCollector.html' target='_top'>Collecting CSS</a>,
      a wellknown tip to avoid slowing the Web page delivery and rendering is
      to avoid too much external links such as external CSS or JavaScript files.
      If a Web application has many CSS files, the programemrs have to collect
      them into a single file. But a single file is hard to maintain. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The solution.</b>
      SAW proposes a Session Binz able to collect several distinct JavaScript files and
      to deliver them as if it was a single JavaScript file. There exist two versions
      of this JavaScript Collector Session Binz. The first version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/JsMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>JsMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>, 
      caches the resulting JavaScript in memory for a quick delivery. And the second version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/JsMultiFileSessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>JsMultiFileSessionBinz</a>
      uses a disk file for caching.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Usage.</b>
      The usage of JavaScript Collector Session Binz is exactly the same
      as that of the CSS Collector Session Binz described in
      <a href='CSSCollector.html' target='_top'>Collecting CSS</a>.
