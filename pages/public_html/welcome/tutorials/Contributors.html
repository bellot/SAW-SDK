	<h1>Call to contributors</h1>

	<p>
	  Any kind of contribution is welcome.
	  Several domains may be covered by contributors.
	</p>

	<h2>Writing Web applications</h2>

	<p>
	  Writing Web applications using SAW-SDK would help popularizing SAW-SDK
	  and debugging it.
	</p>

	<h2>Libraries of XML elements</h2>

	<p>
	  The core of SAW-SDK is rather complete. However, SAW-SDK lacks of
	  components. I mean that CMS propose plugins for including interesting
	  functions in the Web site. We don't have such plugins such as a
	  calendar, a search engine, etc. This king of plugins could be
	  included in a page as a single Dynamic XML element.
	</p>

	<h2>Improving Maven configuration</h2>

	<p>
	  The author fo SAW-SDK is not an expert in Maven.
