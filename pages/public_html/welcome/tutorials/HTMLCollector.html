    <h1>Collecting HTML</h1>

    <p>
      In the same way SAW proposes Session Binz for collecting several CSS files or several
      JavaScript into one,
      SAW also proposes a Session Binz able to collect several distinct HTML files and
      to deliver them as if it was a single HTML file. There exist two versions
      of this HTML Collector Session Binz. The first version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/HtmlMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>HtmlMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>, 
      caches the resulting HTML in memory for a quick delivery. And the second version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/HtmlMultiFileSessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>HtmlMultiFileSessionBinz</a>
      uses a disk file for caching.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Usage.</b>
      Although these HTML Collector Session Binz are not very useful,
      the usage of HTML Collector Session Binz is exactly the same
      as that of the CSS Collector Session Binz described in
      <a href='CSSCollector.html' target='_top'>Collecting CSS</a>.
