    <h1>Collecting CSS</h1>

    <p>
      A wellknown tip to avoid slowing the Web page delivery and rendering is
      to avoid too much external links such as external CSS or JavaScript files.
      If a Web application has many CSS files, the programemrs have to collect
      them into a single file. But a single CSS file is hard to maintain. 
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>The solution.</b>
      SAW proposes a Session Binz able to collect several distinct CSS files and
      to deliver them as if it was a single CSS file. There exist two versions
      of this CSS Collector Session Binz. The first version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>, 
      caches the resulting CSS in memory for a quick delivery. And the second version,
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiFileSessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiFileSessionBinz</a>
      uses a disk file for caching.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Example.</b>
      We use 
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>,
      using 
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiFileSessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiFileSessionBinz</a>
      is exactly the same.
      The class <code>CSS</code> inherits
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>.
      The first argument of the constructor of
      <a href='javadoc/org/saw/sessions/CssMultiMemorySessionBinz.html' target='_blank'>CssMultiMemorySessionBinz</a>
      is a boolean specifying is the resulting CSS must be compacted or not. The the other arguments are the
      names of the CSS files to compact. Note that the names of the CSS files are 
      <u>relative</u> to the <code>CSS</code> class position in the file system. For instance,
      the <code>CSS</code> class is in directory <code>public_html/conference/page</code> as stated
      by the <code>package</code> declaration. The four first CSS files are in the same directory
      meanwhile the three last CSS files are in sibling directories.
    </p>

<pre>
package conference.page ;

import org.saw.sessions.* ;

public final class CSS extends CssMultiMemorySessionBinz
{
    public CSS()
        throws Exception
    {
        super(true,
              "Reset.css",
              "Position.css",
              "Header.css",
              "Main.css",
              "../announces/Announces.css",
              "../navigation/Navigation.css",
              "../footer/Footer.css") ;
    }
}
</pre>
